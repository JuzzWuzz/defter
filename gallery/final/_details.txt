$Geometry Tessellation
$Example of the Geometry Tessellation process. Much higher vertex density around the deformation region illustrated by the wireframe image

11.jpg
$Geometry Tessellation
$Geometry Tessellation applied over the coarse-map. Blended in wireframe mode shows the added vertex density over the stamps.

$Parallax Mapping
$Example of Parallax Mapping to imprint a % in the ground. The background has a coarse deformation to illustrate the displacement of vertices there. Parallax Mapping does not displace any vertices as can be seen in the wireframe section

$Parallax Mapping
$Another example showing that the vertices remain unchanged and the illusion of depth being produced

$Parallax Mapping
$Example with different stamps being applied
